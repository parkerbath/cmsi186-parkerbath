Evaluation for homework 03: ClockSolver

Clock and ClockSolver programs
Includes running Clock main to observe tests
Includes running automated ClockSolver tests
============================================================

Point structure for this assignment is one point wherever indicated.
There are a total of ten points for running ClockSolver with various
input values.  For each test, you get credit if you find *at least*
one occurrence of the angle and log it's time.

You get credit for the main() method for testing the Clock methods,
since I gave that code to you for free.  If you didn't add any more
tests to it, consider doing so from now on, so you'll get full credit
for testing in the module.  Even if you took that code out of Clock.java
or commented it out, it's a freebie.

You also get credit for error any checking code in ClockSolver as follows:
   if you error check directly in the main, you get freebie credit for the
      error two checking methods in Clock.java
   if you error check by calling the ClockSolver validation method, you get
      freebie credit for the other two error checking methods in Clock.java
   if you error check using all three methods, GOOD FOR YOU!! You are an
      increasingly competent Java programmer!!

NOTE: this will be the last time there is this much free credit, so it
will be in your best interest to apply all the discipline that has been
talked about in class - extensive testing, mains in class files, running
the batch/shell scripts against your code, etc.

Also, a not-so-subtle reminder to COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT!!

Comments: Your ClockSolver never actually runs.  All that ever appears
is the welcome message.  I tried with the following parameters:

java ClockSolver  30.0    60.0
java ClockSolver  30.0    10.0
java ClockSolver  30.0     1.0
java ClockSolver  75.23   60.0
java ClockSolver  75.23    7.0
java ClockSolver  75.23    1.3
java ClockSolver  90.0     2.5
java ClockSolver 180.0     1.8
java ClockSolver  90.0  1800.0

You DID write the code, so I'll give you 1/2 credit on those.

Total 23 out of 27 = 66.7% which is a D

Total course grade so far:
