Evaluation
==========

   35.5 out of 34 = 104.41% which is an A-plus

You were supposed to output the count of each denomination on its own line,
per the examples showed in class.  I had to take 1/2 point off for the EC
for that.  You also didn't have the proper naming of the test harness, so
I had to change my script to match.  This was also stated in class, but I
won't take off any points since it was a one character change.

Nice work, and a great ending to a great semester!
